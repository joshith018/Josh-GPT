Josh GPT - AI Chatbot ü§ñ
A custom-built, AI-powered chatbot that emulates the functionality of large language models like ChatGPT in a minimal, fully responsive web application. The frontend, crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, features a dynamic landing page, a modern dark-mode chat interface optimized for both desktop and mobile, and includes advanced UI elements like a chat history sidebar and a "typing" indicator. The entire backend is visually programmed in n8n, which uses a webhook to receive user messages and connects to the high-speed Groq API to generate specialized, persona-based responses from the Llama 3 language model. The complete project is version-controlled with Git and deployed live on the web using GitHub Pages, representing a comprehensive, end-to-end example of modern web and AI application development.
